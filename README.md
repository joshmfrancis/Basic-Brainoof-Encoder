Brainoof, or its more harsh name, Brainfuck, is a Turing complete, stack-based, esoteric programming language made to utterly confuse the programmer using it. It was created by Urban Müller in 1993 and consists of only 8 operators.

Brainoof is one of the OG esoteric programming languages as it inspired many other esolangs. It is a really cool language and is quite challenging to code in! 

Due to the complexity of creating a program in Brainoof, I created an encoder in Python that allows you to input any string of text or numbers and output a compilable Brainoof program! Feel free to test it out for yourself in the compiler I link below! 

Here is a quick test of the program with added code to be able to see the operations on the list "ascii":

Use cases:
 - Build a stronger understanding of programming languages
 - Challenge myself to comprehend difficult concepts

Problems:
 - Due to the simplicity of my program, the output can be rather large. My program doesn't take into account the other operators in Brainoof such as decrementing, inputting , looping, or moving the pointer to the left. I am sure that I could update my program in the future to be able to account for these operators to get a more optimized output for compiling, but my skills are not at that level yet. Maybe that's a project I could work on in the future...
